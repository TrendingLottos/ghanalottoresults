Ghana Lotto is operated by the National Lottery Authority (NLA). Every day of the week, NLA holds drawings of different games, giving players numerous chances to win.


Originally established in 1958, the NLA organized public raffles. Its responsibilities and activities increased over time. As a result of a new government act that regulated lotteries in Ghana, the organization was renamed NLA in 2006. In Ghana, a significant portion of the revenue generated from ticket sales supports good causes.
The first draw was conducted on September 29, 1962.
